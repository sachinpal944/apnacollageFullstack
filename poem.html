    <h1>Ozymandies</h1>
    <!--Poet's Name -->
    <h2>by Percy Bysshe Shelley</h2>
    <!-- Poem -->
     <p>I met a traveller from an antique land <br>
        who said-"Two vast and trunkkess legs of stone <br>
        Stand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand,<br>
        Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,<br />
        And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,<br />
        Tell that its sculptor well those passions read<br />
        which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,<br />
        The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;<br />
        And on the pedestal, these words appear:<br />
        My name is <span>Ozymandies</span>, King of Kings;<br />
        Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!<br />
        Nothing beside remains. Round the decay<br />
        of that colossal Wreck, boundlesss and bare<br /> 
        The lone and level sanda far away."<br />
    </p>
